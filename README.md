# MNITS Classification with Neural Networks
In this project, we first implemented basic neural networks such as Adaline,Madaline,Single Layer Perceptron and MLP then we thought a SOM neural network in order to classify MNITS numbers dataset. After that, we used keras for implementation of a CNN then we classify Fashion-MNITS dataset with it. Finally, we used transfer learning in order to transfer a trained VGGNET to our neural network and classify different pictures with it.
Reports are in Farsi but all results are in English.
